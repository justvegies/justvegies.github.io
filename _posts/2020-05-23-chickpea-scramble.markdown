Breakfast for 2 people

## Recipe

### Whisk together
- 1 cup chickpea flour
- 1 cup [aquafaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquafaba) (3/4 cup is good enough as well)
- 1/2 cup filtered water
- 2 tablespoons [nutritional yeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritional_yeast)
- 1 teaspoon sweet or smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon tumeric
- 1/2 teaspoon [black salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kala_namak)
- a few grinds of black pepper

### Set the mixture aside for about 10 mins

### Prepare onion sides
- 2 medium red or white onions, cut into slices
- 1 medium tomato, cut into chunks

Heat up a skillet with some oil and add onion slices. Fry it until translucent. Then add tomato chunks and stir it for about 2 minutes.

### Fry the scramble
Heat up a skillet with a teaspoon of oil and pour in the mixture. It has to cover entire surface and should not be deeper than 1 cm. The mixture is going to thicken from the bottom. Once the bottom of the mixture is ready to flip then cut it into 4 pieces and flip it one by one. When the entire thing is no longer liquid and ready to be divided into smaller pieces go for it.

### Add onions
Take the fried onions and them to the scramble. Fry it together for another 2 to 3 minutes.

### Serve
That's it, the dish is ready to serve. Tastes delicious with toast and avocado.
